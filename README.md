# MIS517

Goal
----

The objective of the project is to integrate the tools that we have covered in the course, including HTML, CSS, ASP.net and databases. A secondary objective is to provide you with an impressive item to add to your on-line portfolio, should you choose to build one. While working on this project, you will experience the “learning-by-doing” of how to design client/server applications for real-world problems.


Resources Used
--------------
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, 2015
- Github
- GitKraken GUI Client
- MySQL WorkBench - Database Design, EER Diagrams, SQL
- Microsoft Visio - for Data Flow Diagrams


The Project
-----------


The "standard" project will be to build part of a website for “**SCIS**”. 

There will be a project plan with *milestones* and *deliverables.* The milestones serve as control points to verify the proper progress. The project will allow students to integrate many programming tools to achieve the goal. Some of those tools will be discussed in the class. Others can be obtained using the external resources.

Requirements
------------



Team requirements:
------------------

You may work in a team of 2 if you complete the following requirements also.

- You are required to use Github to manage the code for a team project. The project can either be a publicly available project or else the MIS517 professor must be added to the project. Each teammate should have their own github account and commits should be made from the account of the student making the changes. If only one account commits code, only one student will receive credit for completing the project.
