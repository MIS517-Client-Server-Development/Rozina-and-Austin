3. Design a class named Extra_Credit. The class has a method called Calculate which
computes extra credit (bonus) for students based on their attendance, using the following rules:

    - If the student attendance percent >= 90% then the bonus =10 points
    - If the attendance >=70 and <90 then bonus =8
    - If the attendance >=60 and <70 then bonus =6

The result should be stored in a new field in the student information table when the
instructor uses the calculation button on student information page.
